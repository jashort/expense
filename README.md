# Expense
CLI Expense Tracker written in Java

Expense is a simple command-line expense tracker designed to save data to a human-readable
text file stored on the file system. This is primarily so that the data file may be backed
up via standard tools or to a cloud provider.

Its goal is to be compatible with [clexp](http://github.com/jashort/clexp).
